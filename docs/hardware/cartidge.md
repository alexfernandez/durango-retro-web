The Durango cartridge hosts the ROM chip containing any program or game for the **Durango-X** computer.

You can use EPROM, EEPROM or Flash chips to store the software.

Durango-X has up to 32KB of ROM address space, but you can use _BankSwitching_ to store more information, with a suitable cartridge.

For more information about Durango-X cartridges please refer to [Getting Started](../started/).
