Using the "Expansion connector" you can daisy-chain up to 16 devices; some peripherals may integrate several of these devices, like the **Keyboard and Gamepad controller** interface board.

This board provides a **40-key keyboard** and **_two_ gamepad ports**, which are available in _two flavours_:

* NES Flavour; you can connect up to two NES controllers pad using NES connectors.
* MD/Atari flavour; you can connect up to two Mega Drive/Genesis/Atari controllers using DE-9 connectors.

The keyboard interface is _electrically compatible with the **Sinclair ZX Spectrum**_ keyboard matrix; room for the 5-pin and 8-pin sockets is provided in the board, allowing the use of a Sinclair _or any other compatible **5x8 matrix** keyboard_. With suitable connectors, the keys on the board may be connected to a ZX Spectrum, too!
