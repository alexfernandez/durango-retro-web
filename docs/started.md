# Getting Started

Here you cand find information about how to Start with the Durango Computer

## Built your own Durango

IF you want to Create a new Durango Computer, you need to download the Blueprints and obtain the components; you can find the blueprints in the next link.

[https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS/tree/master/hard/kicad/durango/full](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS/tree/master/hard/kicad/durango/full)

To open the blueprints, you need the [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) application.

You will need the Symbols library for this project:

You can see in Kicad an image similar to:

## Built Software for Durango

If you want to built your own Durango Software (like Games or applications), you don't need a Durango to Built Software.

We built some Tools for improve the development of software with Durango. Like:

* Emulator
* Friendly Use C Library (Durango Lib)
* Durango Docker Image
* Visual Studio Code Extensi√≥n (Durango Code)

You can use the Durango Emulator (Perdita), to test your ROMs and play Durango Games; or use the development tools for create your own Durango Applications.

You can find them in the [Development & Tools section](/tools/development/).
