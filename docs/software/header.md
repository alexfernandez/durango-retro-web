# Standard file header

## Rationale

Although **Durango-X** is a _ROM-based_ computer, thus not depending on a proper filesystem, the use of a **mass-storage device** with _ROM image files_
instead of "blowing" and switching physical (E)EPROMs is certainly convenient. Having into account the limitations of an 8-bit computer, especially when
dealing with _huge_ modern storage devices, a fully-featured filesystem implemented on the 6502 side would be pretty cumbersome; thus, an **intermediate
solution** is proposed.

The idea behind this is to simply add a **standard header** to _any_ ROM image (like any individual "file") which creates, by simple _concatenation_, a
**linked list** of ROM images, easily sorted out by the Durango-X computer thru jumping between headers. _This very same principle has been used on the
[minimOS Operating System](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS) as a means to manage ROM contents_, but does apply to mass-storage devices as well,
especially Solid-State ones (like a readily available **SD card**).

This header will provide adequate **metadata**, with some room for expansion. By the way, even if the desired software is going to live on an EPROM
permanently and never downloaded from SD, it _does not harm to have the **Standard Header** all the time_, if you have 256 spare bytes for it.

## Hardware support

The **Durango-X [Development Cartridge]()** provides a convenient way to upload and run software on the Durango-X computer. It provides an extra **32 KiB RAM**
switchable with the standard ROM, plus an inexpensive **SD-card interface**. While standard ROMs (up to 16 KiB) can be placed on this cartridge for regular
use, with a suitable [**bootloader firmware**]() it allows _choosing_ whithin the ROM images stored in the card, _downloading_ any of them in a matter of seconds,
and _running_ the selected software flawlessly -- as the Development Cartridge may _lock_ its RAM after downloading, making it **read-only** just like a
regular ROM.

## Header format

A simple 256-byte block must be provided _in front_ of any ROM image in order to be properly identified and linked to other images on the device.

|9+_n_+_m_|1        |$00           |`NUL`-termination for the above (**mandatory:** if no comment is present, _two_ `NUL`s are expected after _filename_)|

|246 ($F6)|2        |_Version_     |_Little-endian_ 16-bit `%vvvvrrrrppbbbbbb`, where `v` is version number, `r` revision, `b` build and `p` phase (`%00`=alpha, `%01`=beta, `%10`=Release Candidate, `%11`=final)|

|252 ($FC)|4        |**file size** |Includes the 256-byte header. _Unlikely to be over 64 KiB, the last two bytes may be used as **Magic numbers** as well ($00)._

Note that **additional _metadata_** may be included just before the _user field 2_ (offset < 230), as long as a tighter limit is set to _filename+comment_
total length.
